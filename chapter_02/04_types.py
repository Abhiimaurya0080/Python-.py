#  types and typecasting 
# a = 32   # int 
# b = 65.32  # float
# c = "Abhii"  # str
d = "56.23"  # this is str but change the function and now it is float
e = float(d)  # here can change the type of function through typecasting 
t = type(e)
print (t)


#  through this program know about the type of functions that given proggram 'innt ,str , float ' etc.
